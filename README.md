Introduction
Millions of individuals worldwide are affected by heart disease, a life-threatening condition. Lifestyle factors and pre-existing illnesses contribute significantly to the risk of heart disease. This study aims to explore the connections between multiple risk factors and heart disease prevalence using SAS and R for data analysis and visualization.

Aims and Objectives
The primary aim of this study is to investigate relationships between various factors and heart disease using a health-related dataset and SAS and R software. Specific objectives include exploring associations, evaluating software capabilities, and identifying disparities based on sex, age, or race.

Description of the Heart Health Dataset
The dataset used for analysis is derived from the Behavioural Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) and contains information on various health-related variables such as BMI, smoking, drinking, history of strokes, and more.

Design Analysis
The study follows a structured approach involving data cleaning, transformation, modeling, analysis, and reporting. Each step is crucial for ensuring accurate and meaningful results.

Data Analysis
The data analysis section covers detailed procedures and outputs obtained using SAS for descriptive statistics, frequency analysis, logistic regression, and visualization techniques. R analysis is provided in Appendix 2.

SAS and R in-depth Comparison
A critical comparison between SAS and R is presented, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses in terms of installation, data processing, analytics, visualization, and usability.

Conclusion
The study identifies significant risk factors associated with heart disease and emphasizes lifestyle modifications as preventive measures. The insights gained demonstrate the effectiveness of SAS and R in health-related data analysis.

Limitations
The study acknowledges limitations, including dataset constraints and the cross-sectional nature of the data, limiting the establishment of causal relationships.

Future Research
Future research suggestions include longitudinal studies, incorporating additional risk factors, exploring interactions between risk factors, and developing predictive models.
